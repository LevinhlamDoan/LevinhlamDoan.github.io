    <h1>Project: Relationship between Migration, Ethnicity, and House Prices in the UK</h1>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This SQL project analyzes the relationship between migration flows, ethnic composition, and house prices in the UK using various datasets from the UK Data Service.</p>

    <h2>Data Sources</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/" target="_blank">UK Data Service</a> - Includes House Price Dataset (2020), Ethnicity data, and Migration flow data from the 2021 UK census.</li>
        <li><strong>Boundary Data:</strong> Middle Layer Super Output Areas (MSOAs).This boundary includes 6856 Middle Layer Super Output Areas.</li>
        <li><strong>House Price Dataset (2020):</strong> Includes postcode, price, and house condition. The dataset includes 65427 postcodes. I converted them to longitude and latitude coordinates, allowing us to map these locations against Middle Layer Super Output Areas (MSOAs) boundaries.</li>
        <li><strong>Ethnicity Dataset:</strong> Census 2021 estimates of ethnic groups in England and Wales.It includes 145280 cases</li>
        <li><strong>Migration Datasets:</strong> Tracks migration flows between MSOAs in 2021, including 9999 flows between areas</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Relationships</h2>
    <p>The project analyzes the following relationships:</p>
    <img src="path/to/your/image.jpg" alt="Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Price_Area to Migration:</strong> One-to-Many</li>
        <li><strong>Price_Area to Ethnicity:</strong> One-to-Many</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Migration and Ethnicity do not have a direct relationship but can be analyzed together through the Price_Area table.</p>

    <h2>SQL Query Examples</h2>
    <p>Here are the SQL queries used in this project:</p>

    <h3>1. Average House Prices by MSOA</h3>
    <pre><code>SELECT 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Average_Price DESC) AS OrderID,
    MLSOA_Name, 
    Average_Price
FROM 
    Price_Area
ORDER BY 
    Average_Price DESC
LIMIT 10;</code></pre>

    <h3>2. Total Transactions by MSOA</h3>
    <pre><code>SELECT 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Total_Transactions DESC) AS OrderID,
    MLSOA_Name, 
    Total_Transactions
FROM (
    SELECT 
        MLSOA_Name, 
        SUM(Transactions) AS Total_Transactions
    FROM 
        Price_Area
    GROUP BY 
        MLSOA_Name
) AS Subquery
ORDER BY 
    Total_Transactions DESC
LIMIT 20;</code></pre>

    <h3>3. Migration Counts for Each Current MSOA</h3>
    <pre><code>SELECT 
    m.Current_MLSOA_Code, 
    pa.MLSOA_name,
    SUM(m.Count) AS Total_Migrants 
FROM 
    Migration m
Inner Join
    Price_Area pa On m.Current_MLSOA_Code = pa.Current_MLSOA_Code
GROUP BY 
    m.Current_MLSOA_Code, pa.MLSOA_Name
ORDER BY 
    Total_Migrants DESC;</code></pre>

    <h3>4. Distinct Ethnic Categories and Maximum Observations</h3>
    <pre><code> WITH MaxObservations AS (
    SELECT
        Current_MLSOA_Code,
        Ethnic_Categories,
        MAX(Observation) AS Max_Number
    FROM
        Ethnicity
    GROUP BY
        Current_MLSOA_Code,
        Ethnic_Categories
)

SELECT 
    pa.MLSOA_Name,
    mo.Ethnic_Categories,
    mo.Max_Number
FROM 
    MaxObservations mo
INNER JOIN 
    Price_Area pa ON mo.Current_MLSOA_Code = pa.Current_MLSOA_Code
WHERE 
    (mo.Ethnic_Categories, mo.Max_Number) IN (
        SELECT 
            Ethnic_Categories, 
            MAX(Max_Number)
        FROM 
            MaxObservations
        GROUP BY 
            Ethnic_Categories
    )
ORDER BY 
    mo.Ethnic_Categories, mo.Max_Number DESC;</code></pre>

    <h3>5. Total Number of Migrants, Grouped and Ordered </h3>
    <pre><code>SELECT 
    pa.MLSOA_Name,
    m.Current_MLSOA_Code,
    SUM(m.Count) AS Total_Migrants
FROM 
    Migration m
INNER JOIN 
    Price_Area pa ON pa.Current_MLSOA_Code = m.Current_MLSOA_Code
GROUP BY 
    pa.MLSOA_Name, m.Current_MLSOA_Code
ORDER BY 
    Total_Migrants DESC;</code></pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This project provides valuable insights into how migration and ethnic diversity relate to house prices in different areas of the UK.</p>
