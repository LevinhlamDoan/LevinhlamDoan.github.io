    <h1>Project: Relationship between Migration, Ethnicity, and House Prices in the UK</h1>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This SQL project analyzes the relationship between migration flows, ethnic composition, and house prices in the UK using various datasets from the UK Data Service.</p>

    <h2>Data Sources</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/" target="_blank">UK Data Service</a> - Includes House Price Dataset (2020), Ethnicity data, and Migration flow data from the 2021 UK census.</li>
        <li><strong>Boundary Data:</strong> Middle Layer Super Output Areas (MSOAs).</li>
        <li><strong>House Price Dataset (2020):</strong> Includes postcode, price, and house condition.</li>
        <li><strong>Ethnicity Dataset:</strong> Census 2021 estimates of ethnic groups in England and Wales.</li>
        <li><strong>Migration Datasets:</strong> Tracks migration flows between MSOAs in 2021.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Relationships</h2>
    <p>The project analyzes the following relationships:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Price_Area to Migration:</strong> One-to-Many</li>
        <li><strong>Price_Area to Ethnicity:</strong> One-to-Many</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Migration and Ethnicity do not have a direct relationship but can be analyzed together through the Price_Area table.</p>

    <h2>SQL Query Examples</h2>
    <p>Here are some example SQL queries used in this project:</p>

    <h3>1. Average House Prices by MSOA</h3>
    <pre><code>SELECT 
    MLSOA_Name, 
    Average_Price 
FROM 
    Price_Area
ORDER BY 
    Average_Price DESC;</code></pre>

    <h3>2. Total Transactions by MSOA</h3>
    <pre><code>SELECT 
    MLSOA_Name, 
    SUM(Transactions) AS Total_Transactions 
FROM 
    Price_Area
GROUP BY 
    MLSOA_Name
ORDER BY 
    Total_Transactions DESC;</code></pre>

    <h3>3. Migration Counts for Each Current MSOA</h3>
    <pre><code>SELECT 
    Current_MSOA_Name, 
    SUM(Count) AS Total_Migrants 
FROM 
    Migration
GROUP BY 
    Current_MSOA_Name
ORDER BY 
    Total_Migrants DESC;</code></pre>

    <h3>4. Ethnic Composition of Each MSOA</h3>
    <pre><code>SELECT 
    MLSOA_Name, 
    Ethnic_Categories, 
    SUM(Observation) AS Total_Observation 
FROM 
    Ethnicity 
JOIN 
    Price_Area ON Ethnicity.Current_MLSOA_Code = Price_Area.Current_MLSOA_Code
GROUP BY 
    MLSOA_Name, 
    Ethnic_Categories
ORDER BY 
    MLSOA_Name, 
    Total_Observation DESC;</code></pre>

    <h3>5. Analyze Migration Patterns</h3>
    <pre><code>SELECT 
    Previous_MSOA_Name, 
    Current_MSOA_Name, 
    SUM(Count) AS Total_Movers 
FROM 
    Migration 
GROUP BY 
    Previous_MSOA_Name, 
    Current_MSOA_Name
ORDER BY 
    Total_Movers DESC;</code></pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This project provides valuable insights into how migration and ethnic diversity relate to house prices in different areas of the UK.</p>
