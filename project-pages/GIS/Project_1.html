        <div class="body-text">This paper investigated the relationship between migration areas segmented by house price levels and three factors associated with householdsâ€™ characteristics including age, migration distance and previous areas grouped by house price levels. By using cross tabulation analysis and Chi-Square test together with GIS techniques the paper indicated there was significant connections between destination migration areas based on house price ranges either with household age groups, migration distance ranges or previous locations associated with particular house price levels. The paper also presented such relationships on a series of GIS maps, helping us clearly identify several specific spatial patterns.</div>

          <div class="body-text">The project aims to demonstrate the usefulness of a GIS approach to explore the spatial connections between migration flow, house price level, age and distance. Based on the 2011 migration flow data and the 2011 house price data in Greater Manchester in the UK, the paper conducted the Chi-Square tests and produced a series of visual maps to show the spatial relationship between migration flow, distance, age and migration areas segmented by house price levels. The results indicated the strong spatial linkages between migration areas based on the consideration of house price ranges either with age groups, distance ranges or previous locations associated with particular house price levels. Policymakers and planners could use this GIS approach to identify specific migration patterns and areas and help them make informed decisions.</div>
          <div class="body-text">The paper used the boundaries of Output Areas (8,684 areas), Merged Wards (215 areas) from the 2011 UK Census data and the 2011 house price data (with 25,872 postcodes) from the Land Registry data source in Greater Manchester. 

Furthermore, the paper employed the migration flow data from the 2011 UK Census, and the dataset were downloadable at https://wicid.ukdataservice.ac.uk/. The data included the information about the migration flows from previous areas (one year before) to current destination areas at the levels of output areas and merged wards in Greater Manchester.</div>
