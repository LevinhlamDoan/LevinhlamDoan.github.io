    </p>This study leverages Rightmove plc's large-scale search data to assess the predictive potential of online property portal data on housing market trends, employing GIS to reveal mismatches between what people search for and their actual housing choices. It utilizes 2013 data from Rightmove and the Land Registry, employing K-means clustering and linear regression to analyze demand patterns and the relationship between online views and house sales values. The findings highlight a strong correlation between online property interest and sales, suggesting new avenues for predicting market activities and informing housing supply decisions. Despite limitations such as identifying genuine search intent and data representation issues, the research offers valuable insights into housing demand estimation and submarket analysis, underscoring the social implications of using GIS for land allocation based on consumer preferences. This original contribution showcases the utility of combining user-generated search data with GIS analysis to fill knowledge gaps in market behavior and planning methodologies, emphasizing its international relevance and value. </p>

            <h2>Map 1: Search patterns in Greater Manchester based on bedroom number and price in 2013</h2>
            <img class="project-image" src="Images/GIS_2.1.jpg" alt="Search patterns in Greater Manchester based on bedroom number and price in 2013">
            <p>Intensive searches were conducted for two and three-bedroom houses in all price ranges while searches for one-bedroom or four and more bedrooms were at the lower level. Searching for one-bedroom was mainly focused on the centre of Greater Manchester, around City Center while searching for four bedrooms or more was more fragmented across all housing market areas.</p>

            <p>In terms of price ranges, people searching for 2 or 3 bedrooms in the price ranges 110K- 151K were more scattered while their searches for 2 or 3 beds in the price above 151K were more concentrated in the South of Greater Manchester. There was also a lack of searches for one and four or more bedrooms. The results from the analysis highlighted the high demand for specific house price bands and helped us explore household demand for particular locations.</p>

        <p>The result of the paper was that there exist spatial and structural submarkets based on online housing search and these search-based segmentations fit well with the existing local housing market areas. The paper also found the mismatch between what people searched for and what they had chosen for the specific house price ranges and locations. Moreover, the paper demonstrated that by analysing the ratios of the sold property numbers to the listed property numbers and the ratios of the online property searches to the listed property numbers within a particular area it is possible to identify the patterns of latent demand within that area and distinguish the search patterns created by those who are intended to buy hones and by those who who are not intended to buy homes.

The paper contributes the GIS-based approach to explore the mismatch between search patterns and choice patterns regarding similar price ranges and locations. This approach is based on the use of the online property search data from online property portals such as Rightmove and the paid house price data from Land Registry. This approach could be used in any area where these kinds of data are available. This paper also contributes to the growing trend in analysing online housing search data to estimate housing needs and demands.</p>
