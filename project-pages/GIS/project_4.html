            <h2>Project Objective:</h2>
            <p>The objective of this project is to analyze the relationship between ethnicity groups and house prices within England using spatial analysis techniques in QGIS and SQL queries for data manipulation and analysis.</p>

            <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <h3>Data Acquisition:</h3>
            <ul>
                <!-- List of data acquisition steps -->
            </ul>

            <h3>Data Preparation:</h3>
            <ul>
                <!-- List of data preparation steps -->
            </ul>

            <h3>Spatial Analysis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <!-- List of spatial analysis steps -->
            </ul>

            <h3>SQL Analysis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <!-- List of SQL analysis steps -->
            </ul>

            <h3>Visualization and Reporting:</h3>
            <ul>
                <!-- List of visualization and reporting steps -->
            </ul>

            <h2>Expected Outcome:</h2>
            <p>Through the project, I have gained insights into the spatial distribution of ethnicity groups and their potential impact on house prices within England. Through the integration of QGIS for spatial analysis and SQL for data manipulation, I have demonstrated proficiency in analyzing complex socio-economic phenomena using geospatial data.</p>
