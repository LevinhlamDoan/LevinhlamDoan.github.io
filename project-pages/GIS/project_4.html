            <h2>Project Objective:</h2>
            <p>The objective of this project is to analyze the relationship between ethnicity groups and house prices within England using spatial analysis techniques in QGIS and SQL queries for data manipulation and analysis.</p>

            <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <h3>Data Acquisition:</h3>
            <ul>
                Obtain UK Census data from 2021, which includes demographic information, including ethnicity groups, at a detailed geographic level Middle layer Super Output Areas (MSOAs). There are 6,856 MSOAs in England.
            <p>Acquire house price data for England for the year 2020. This data is available from the Land Registry website.</p>
               <p>Acquire ethnicity data from the UK Data Service website at https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/</p>

            </ul>

            <h3>Data Preparation:</h3>
            <ul>
                Convert house price data with postcodes to longitude and latitude coordinates using https://www.doogal.co.uk/BatchGeocoding
Load the UK Census data and house price data into QGIS.
Ensure that both datasets are in compatible formats and projections.
Using K-means clustering to group house prices in QGIS with 68 clusters and prior research suggesting that this number of clusters is appropriate for the analysis
Join the census data representing ethnicity groups with the house price data based on a common geographic identifier MSOA code.

            </ul>

            <h3>Spatial Analysis:</h3>
            <ul>
                Utilize QGIS tools to conduct spatial analysis on the data:
Mapping the spatial distribution of ethnicity groups and house price clusters.
Creating thematic maps to visualize the relationship between ethnicity groups and house prices.
Identifying areas with high concentrations of specific ethnicity groups and examining how they correlate with house prices.
Conducting spatial autocorrelation analysis to detect spatial patterns and clusters.

            </ul>

            <h3>SQL Analysis:</h3>
            <ul>
                Export the joined dataset from QGIS to a SQL-compatible database.
Write SQL queries to perform additional analysis on the data including:
Calculate summary statistics for house prices within different ethnicity groups.
Identify correlations between ethnicity composition and house prices.
Explore the relationship between other socio-economic factors and house prices, such as income levels or education attainment, in conjunction with ethnicity data.

            </ul>

            <h3>Visualization and Reporting:</h3>
            <ul>
                Generate visualizations (maps, charts, graphs) based on the results of the spatial and SQL analysis.
Create a comprehensive report summarizing the findings of the analysis, including any correlations or patterns observed between ethnicity groups and house prices in England.
Provide insights and recommendations based on the analysis for relevant stakeholders, such as urban planners, policymakers, or real estate developers.

            </ul>

            <h2>Outcome:</h2>
            <p>Through the project, I have gained insights into the spatial distribution of ethnicity groups and their potential impact on house prices within England. Through the integration of QGIS for spatial analysis and SQL for data manipulation, I have demonstrated proficiency in analyzing complex socio-economic phenomena using geospatial data.</p>
